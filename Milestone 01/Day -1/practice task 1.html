        <p>In the beginning I didn’t keep any records about my travels. Even when changing laptops, I
            didn’t transfer old files with plans, maps, and descriptions of places worth visiting. I must
            admit, I really regret it now. Later, when I wanted to talk about some particularly interesting
            place, I began to realize that details were falling out of my memory. I remember that I ate in
            a very authentic restaurant in a village not far from Asti, but the name of the village has
            already been erased from my memory. And I began to describe my travels very briefly in one of
            the social networks. First, a week-long trip with one or two posts. And lately I’ve been
            keeping a diary in which I record the most vivid impressions every day.
